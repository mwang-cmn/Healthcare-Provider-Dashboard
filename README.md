### Project Introduction: Healthcare Provider Dashboard

This project presents a Healthcare Provider Dashboard designed in Power BI to visualize key financial metrics related to healthcare billing and treatment costs across different departments and procedures. It leverages healthcare data to provide insights into the total billing amounts, treatment costs, medication costs, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket expenses.

The dashboard features:

- **High-Level Financial Overview**: Displays key figures such as total billing amount (£3.4M), treatment costs (£3M), medication costs (£546K), insurance coverage (£2.2M), out-of-pocket costs (£1.1M), and room charges (£180K). 
- **Location-Based Insights**: Allows users to select between cities and states, with a map visualization showing the total billing amount by city, giving a geographic context to healthcare expenditures.
- **Procedure and Department Breakdown**: Highlights the percentage of total billing amounts by different medical procedures, such as X-ray, CT Scan, and MRI, as well as the billing distribution across departments like Cardiology, Orthopedics, General Medicine, Neurology, and Pediatrics.
- **Diagnosis and Service Type Insights**: Provides insights into the billing amounts by diagnosis (e.g., hypertension, asthma, migraine) and by service type (emergency, inpatient, outpatient), showing the distribution of healthcare spending across different conditions and services.

This project demonstrates how visual analytics can simplify the understanding of complex healthcare financial data and can be used to assist healthcare providers in monitoring and managing their operational and financial performance.
